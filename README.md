# 🚗 Vehicle History Checker - Waitlist Page

This is the waitlist page for the Vehicle History Checker platform — a digital system designed to help vehicle buyers in Ghana verify the history and authenticity of vehicles before purchase. Users can join the waitlist to get early access and updates about the project.

## 🌟 Purpose

Due to the lack of a standardized vehicle history system in Ghana, this project aims to:
- Help buyers avoid stolen or accident-prone vehicles.
- Improve road safety.
- Enhance transparency in vehicle transactions.
- Provide access to real-time vehicle records from official sources.

The waitlist page allows interested users to:
- Learn about the platform’s goals.
- Sign up to receive early updates.
- Be notified when the beta or full product is launched.

## 📸 Features
